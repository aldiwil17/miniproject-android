<img src="file:///android_asset/news_initial.png" /><br/>
You are asked to improve the page by the following tasks.<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>
        Improve the view by showing the <b>loading state</b> when loading the data, <b>empty state</b> when the data is empty, and <b>error and retry state</b> when the data is error.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Currently the page is showing only up to 20 data of the first page. You have to add capability to <b>Load More</b> if the user go to the bottom of the list.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Show the <b>Slider Banner</b> in the top of the list. It shows up to 5 of headline news data (See documentation from the newsapi.org!).<br /><br />
        User can slide the slider to the left/right. The slider has the page indicator in the bottom and periodically can turn to next page every 5 seconds.<br /><br />

        Below is illustration of the slider<br />

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Format the date!</b> Instead of 2009-01-10T20:45:00Z, you have to put the date to 10 January 2009. The date should aligned with the user's local device.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Instead of showing the date to each item, You are asked to <b>group the news by date</b>.<br />
        For example:<br />
        10 January 2019<br />
        [News 1]<br />
        [News 2]<br />
        9 January 2019<br />
        [News 3]<br />
        [News 4]<br />
        [News 5]<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Add <b>Search capability</b> to allow the user to search the news by the keyword he/she wants.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Add <b>offline capability</b> by storing the news to the database, so the news can be shown to user even he/she is not online.<br /><br />
    </li>
</ul>
